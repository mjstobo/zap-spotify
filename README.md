# Zap Spotify

Powered by the Spotify and Datamuse APIs, Zap Spotify is a tool that allows users to curate themed playlists using a keyword. 

Live application can be seen on Heroku [here](https://zap-spotify.herokuapp.com)

## Implementation

Zap is a React application and a NodeJS / Express API. SASS has been used for styling throughout. 

It is integrated with the Spotify API via OAuth to allow users to search, play and add songs to a playlist. 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Local Build

Unfortunately, the local build requires a Spotify Client ID / Secret to run properly. I'd be more than happy to demonstrate the code for the application if interested, just reach out!
